# FlySimulatorProject

FlySimulator is a project, where we were given a text file with different commands (in essence a made up language). We interpret the commands to interact with a flight simulator, in order to enable the plane in the simulator, to fly. 

# Downloads/Files
In order to work with the simulator, we need to install the application "FlightGear". We will also be working with a text file of all the commands, with which we will be able to communicate with the simulator

#Installation of FlightGear
Instructions for installation are on the following website
